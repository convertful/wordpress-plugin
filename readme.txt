* **Design and templates variety** — Design quality and diversity are one of our key principles. Use unique in-lines, pop-ups, sideboxes (slideins), fullscreens and floating bars.
* **Right audience, right time, right place** — Flexibly set your forms’ behavior: when and where to show, and when NOT to show them. Convertful forms will never annoy your visitors.
* **Returning and leaving visitors** — Target returning and leaving leads, target your audiences exactly by source and time — while existing subscribers will not be distracted by forms.
* **Responsive forms** — All opt-in forms are mobile-friendly. Period. Your visitors will never fall enraged by inconvenient mobile experience.
* **A/B-testing** — Test your [lead magnets](https://app.convertful.com/docs/lead-magnets/), understand your audience’s preferences and become ultimately convertful.
* **Easy stats without Google Analytics** — We offer an easy way to view your funnel results without connecting to Google Analytics: see which form brought you subscribers, what was it conversion, how many visitors and impressions there were.
* **All functions from the start** — We don’t limit you anywhere during the trial. Try the full barrage of functions that are seldom are only available for much higher prices.
