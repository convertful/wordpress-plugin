### Convertful Plugin to Grow Subscriber Base Fast

To convert visitors into subscribers, you need to use opt-in forms. Our behavior-based pop-ups, sideboxes (slideins), floating bars, fullscreens and in-lines will grow your email list quickly and with a great visual style. Convertful has flexible behavior and targeting settings, three-minutes-to-result form builder, easy stats, does not affect website speed and has no limits for the number of visitors, forms and integrations.

Capture leads with different subscribe, signup, newsletter and download forms connected with your MailChimp, ConvertKit, AWeber, GetResponse and 25+ other email services accounts. We have a [support portal with an “it’s done” A-team](https://app.convertful.com/tickets) and provide [clear step-by-step instructions.](https://app.convertful.com/docs/)

* **Design and templates variety** — Design quality and diversity are one of our key principles. Use unique in-lines, pop-ups, sideboxes (slideins), fullscreens and floating bars.
* **Right audience, right time, right place** — Flexibly set your forms’ behavior: when and where to show, and when NOT to show them. Convertful forms will never annoy your visitors.
* **Returning and leaving visitors** — Target returning and leaving leads, target your audiences exactly by source and time — while existing subscribers will not be distracted by forms.
* **Responsive forms** — All opt-in forms are mobile-friendly. Period. Your visitors will never fall enraged by inconvenient mobile experience.
* **A/B-testing** — Test your [lead magnets](https://app.convertful.com/docs/lead-magnets/), understand your audience’s preferences and become ultimately convertful.
* **Easy stats without Google Analytics** — We offer an easy way to view your funnel results without connecting to Google Analytics: see which form brought you subscribers, what was it conversion, how many visitors and impressions there were.
* **All functions from the start** — We don’t limit you anywhere during the trial. Try the full barrage of functions that are seldom are only available for much higher prices.
